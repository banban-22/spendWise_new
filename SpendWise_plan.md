## About the Project

1. This app is about to keep record financial expense and income.
   The user can change currency, so that people in all over the world are able to use it.
   Moreover, they can check the currency rate through the app, which means when they are going to other countries (and use other currencies) they can easily keep recording with this app.
   Also, there is a feature of input data from the receipt.
   The user can see the summary of usage and input on their top page.

2. I'm not a person who keeps financial records, but one of my friends keeps records very strictly in her journal every month. She/He keeps all receipts every time. I think I can help her/him save time by creating a financial record app, as typing is much faster than writing. Additionally, the app can automatically generate summarized data, eliminating the need for manual calculations.

Furthermore, as an international student, incorporating a currency conversion feature into the financial record-keeping app is crucial. This feature would allow users who need to use their savings in their home country to easily track their expenditures by comparing them to their local currency.

## Strategy

### 3. Target

- People who comes from other countries (Business to Customers)

### 4. Questions for users

- What makes a good experience (shopping, watching, searching, etc)?

  - Summarizing the Reports for monthly financial usage

- What things would the user usually do first? Why?

  - Going to Transaction page, and adding the testing data because the users usually would like to know how it works and what features the app has.

- What would the user put off as long as they can? Why?

  - They sometimes prograstinate updating their financial record regularly. Because it takes some time, and they need to see how much they spent (which might be stressful for most of people who cares about the monthly budget)

- How often does or would the user use the product?

  - At least once a week since the user keep checking how much they have used and they can use in a month.

- What would or does the user use the product for most often?

  - The users can check the summarized data, so they will use the dashboard page most often to check their financial status

- If the user has an existing product that they use, how do they use it?

  - They might use this app for checking the currency conversion data

- What things or products are used before, during, or after using this product?

  - They are using bank apps to check transaction (especially credit card transaction) for gathering their transaction record before using this app, and after using this app and export their transaction data, they are keep it in thier computer or hard copying, and store it.

- How can the product compare to others the user has used before?
  - They can compare this app in terms of the ease of use. How much they are easily keep recording. Also, they can compare to others in terms of the accuracy, which means how much accurate the currency conversion rate is.

For our financial app, we will use a combination of organizing principles to ensure a user-friendly and efficient experience. These principles will revolve around the app's core functionalities and user needs. The primary organizing principles we will employ are "Audience" and "Functionality."

**Audience-Based Organization:**
Considering the diverse user base of our financial app, we will employ audience-based organization to cater to different user segments. Our user authentication and management system will play a crucial role in this aspect. Users will sign up and log in to their personalized accounts, allowing them to access their individualized financial data securely. This approach will enable us to offer tailored experiences to various user groups, such as individual consumers, business owners, and students.

**Functionality-Based Organization:**
We recognize the importance of effective expense tracking and financial management. Our app's core features, including expense tracking, income tracking, and multi-currency support, will be organized based on their functionality. Users will seamlessly input and categorize expenses, record income sources, and utilize the automatic currency exchange feature. This functional organization ensures that users can easily find and utilize the tools they need to manage their financial activities efficiently.

In summary, our financial app's information architecture will be organized primarily based on audience segments and core functionalities. This structure aims to provide users with a streamlined experience that caters to their individual needs while ensuring efficient financial management and analysis.

## Surface/UI

### 17.

In alignment with the goals and objectives outlined in our "business" plan, we have carefully selected design elements that resonate with our vision and enhance the user experience.

**Color Scheme: Orange**
Our chosen color scheme of orange reflects our commitment to energy, enthusiasm, and vibrancy. Orange is a color that resonates with optimism and innovation, which perfectly aligns with our financial app's aim to empower users in their financial management journey. The warm and inviting nature of orange also instills a sense of trust and approachability, inviting users to engage with our app with confidence.

**Fonts: Montserrat (Sans-Serif)**
We have opted for the Montserrat font, a sleek and contemporary sans-serif typeface. This font choice complements our goal of creating an app that is modern, easy to read, and user-friendly. Montserrat's clean lines and versatile weights ensure that our app's content is presented legibly across different devices, maintaining a consistent and professional appearance.

**Design Decisions: Easiness of Use**
Central to our design philosophy is the principle of easiness of use. We have made conscious design decisions that prioritize intuitive navigation, clear visual hierarchy, and minimal clutter. Our user interface is designed to guide users seamlessly through the app's features, ensuring that even individuals with varying levels of financial knowledge can navigate and interact comfortably.

The combination of the energetic orange color scheme, the readability and modernity of the Montserrat font, and the overarching focus on ease of use collectively contribute to an app design that resonates with our goals and objectives. Our design elements not only reflect our brand identity but also enhance the overall user experience, fostering trust and engagement among our users.
