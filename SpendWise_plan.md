## About the Project

1. This app is about to keep record financial expense and income.
   The user can change currency, so that people in all over the world are able to use it.
   Moreover, they can check the currency rate through the app, which means when they are going to other countries (and use other currencies) they can easily keep recording with this app.
   Also, there is a feature of input data from the receipt.
   The user can see the summary of usage and input on their top page.

2. I'm not a person who keeps financial records, but one of my friends keeps records very strictly in her journal every month. She/He keeps all receipts every time. I think I can help her/him save time by creating a financial record app, as typing is much faster than writing. Additionally, the app can automatically generate summarized data, eliminating the need for manual calculations.

Furthermore, as an international student, incorporating a currency conversion feature into the financial record-keeping app is crucial. This feature would allow users who need to use their savings in their home country to easily track their expenditures by comparing them to their local currency.

## Strategy

### Target

3. People who comes from other countries (Business to Customers)

4. Questions for users

- What makes a good experience (shopping, watching, searching, etc)?

  - Summarizing the Reports for monthly financial usage

- What things would the user usually do first? Why?

  - Going to Transaction page, and adding the testing data because the users usually would like to know how it works and what features the app has.

- What would the user put off as long as they can? Why?

  - They sometimes prograstinate updating their financial record regularly. Because it takes some time, and they need to see how much they spent (which might be stressful for most of people who cares about the monthly budget)

- How often does or would the user use the product?

  - At least once a week since the user keep checking how much they have used and they can use in a month.

- What would or does the user use the product for most often?

  - The users can check the summarized data, so they will use the dashboard page most often to check their financial status

- If the user has an existing product that they use, how do they use it?

  - They might use this app for checking the currency conversion data

- What things or products are used before, during, or after using this product?

  - They are using bank apps to check transaction (especially credit card transaction) for gathering their transaction record before using this app, and after using this app and export their transaction data, they are keep it in thier computer or hard copying, and store it.

- How can the product compare to others the user has used before?
  - They can compare this app in terms of the ease of use. How much they are easily keep recording. Also, they can compare to others in terms of the accuracy, which means how much accurate the currency conversion rate is.

### Goals

5. The goal of this app is to create an application that caters to the needs of international users who wish to easily maintain their financial records.
